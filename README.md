# Neural data science 
Assignments and final project.

We need to agree on a shared folder structure. I suggest the following. The directories will otherwise become very cluttered with lots of subdirectories for the data.

'''
.
├── data
│  └── nds_cl_1.csv
├── notebooks
│  └── CodingLab1.ipynb
├── project
│  └── ...
├── README.md
├── matplotlib_style.txt
├── requirements.txt
└── .gitignore
'''

## Tools
- `black` to format code. Can be installed with pip or as VSCode extension.
- `nbdev` to make notebooks trackable via git.
